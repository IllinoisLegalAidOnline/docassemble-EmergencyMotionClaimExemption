  If the other party listed an email address on the court documents, you must send the forms to them by email or through the e-filing system. You may use US mail or a delivery company, or hand delivery if you or the other party **does not** have an email address. If you are in a prison or jail, you can deliver by mail.

  For best results, complete the Proof of Delivery section and send the forms today.

  **Note:** If you do not know this now, be sure to add it to the Proof of Delivery section of your forms later.
